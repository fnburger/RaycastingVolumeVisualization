The histogram automatically updates when loading a new dataset.
The transition is animated: the old histogram fades to black before the update.

The stepsize along each ray can easily be changed using the sampling rate slider in the editor.
We chose 50.0 as default for the multiplier because the performance is decent and the volume data looks pretty much the same as with higher sampling rates.
